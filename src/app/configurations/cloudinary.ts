/**
 ⚡ Multer Full Cycle (Explicit One-Line Flow):

Client fills a form with text + files
→ Browser sends an HTTP POST request with multipart/form-data
→ Express receives the raw request stream
→ Multer middleware intercepts the request before it reaches your route
→ Multer hands the stream to Busboy, which parses the multipart data into chunks (fields + files)
→ For each field, Busboy emits an event and Multer stores it in req.body
→ For each file, Busboy streams it to the configured Storage Engine (Disk, Memory, or custom)
→ The storage engine writes the file (to disk, memory, or cloud) and gives back file metadata
→ Multer collects that metadata and attaches it to req.file (for single) or req.files (for multiple)
→ Once parsing finishes, Multer calls next() and control passes to your route handler
→ In the route, you access req.body and req.file(s) as normal JS objects
→ You send a response back to the client confirming success or failure.
 */

// Form submission → HTTP POST request → Express server → Multer middleware → Busboy parser → Storage engine saves file → Multer attaches data → Route handler runs → Response returned
